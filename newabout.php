            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <p>I’ve always had an eye for style and a passion for accessories, which led me to start my own line of caps. From an early age, I knew that small details like a great cap could really complete an outfit and express individuality.

Over the years, I’ve worked with a variety of fabrics and materials, refining my craft to offer you nothing but the best. My mission is to bring you caps that are both functional and fashionable, no matter your personal style.

I’ve spent countless hours researching trends, testing designs, and perfecting fit, all so you get the perfect cap every time. I’m constantly looking for ways to innovate and keep my products fresh and exciting. Every cap I make is a reflection of my commitment to quality, comfort, and timeless design.</p>

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p>At Cap, we pride ourselves on a long-standing commitment to offering high-quality products with a focus on style and durability. With over 2 years in the industry, I have built my expertise around understanding what makes a cap not just functional, but an essential part of daily wear.

I started this journey because I recognized a gap in the market for caps that combined comfort, fashion, and superior craftsmanship. With a passion for design and a commitment to customer satisfaction, I have created a brand that puts quality and style at the forefront of every product we offer.</p>
